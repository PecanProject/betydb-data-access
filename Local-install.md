# Installing a local version of BETYdb

A standard ODB database provides access to the back-end PostgreSQL database server. This database may be hosted on a production server. You can also install a version of BETYdb on your own comptuer

The following scripts make it easy to install the latest version of BETYdb locally \(on Linux or OSX\), populated with all public data.  
Many users of [PEcAn](https://www.pecanproject.org) install a local copy of BETYdb, and BETYdb can sync across different servers.  
The [PEcAn repository](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan) provides useful configuration files.  
Their use is described in the developer's guide to [installing PEcAn](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/wiki/Installing-PEcAn).  
You can also run BETYdb on pre-configured PEcAn Virtual Machines using a VirtualBox or similar  software, and can be run on a laptop, desktop, server, or cloud services such as Amazon cloud or NCSA OpenStack.
