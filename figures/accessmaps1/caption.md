**Advance Search: Map Based**

Advance search using maps is used by seraching for a specific site(city), species and trait. The results of the search are then shown in Google Maps. Sites, species and traits can be searched further by clicking on the geographical location on the map. Additionally, there is a legand that shows selected sites that  match serach, don't match search, and sites that fall outside search area. All of these results can be downloaded by clicking the "download results" button on the upper right hand corner. 

**CSV Downloads**

Data can be downloaded as a .csv= file, and data from previously published syntheses can be downloaded without login. For example, to download all of the Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) yield data,

Open the BETY homepage www.betydb.org
Select Species under BETYdb
Select Yields under BETYdb
To download all records as a comma-delimited (.csv) file, scroll down and select the link http://ebi-forecast.igb.uiuc.edu/bety/maps/yields?format=csv&species=938 *(In CSV Format)

### API keys

Using an API key allows access to data without having to enter a login. To use an API key, simply append @?key=@ to the end of the URL. Each user must obtain a unique API key.

### Installing BETY (the complete database)

There are two flavors of BETY: PHP and RUBY. The PHP version allows for minimal interaction with the database while the RUBY version allows for full interaction with the database. Both, however, require the database to be created and installed.
