# Guide to accessing data from BETYdb

Data is made available for analysis after it is submitted and reviewed by a database administrator. These data are suitable for basic scientific research and modeling. All reviewed data are made publicly available after publication to users of BETY-db who are conducting primary research. Access to these raw data is provided to users based on affiliation and contribution of data.

## Search Box

On the welcome page of BETYdb there is a search option for trait and yield data. This tool allows users to search the entire database for specific sites, species, and traits.

### Searching with text

### Searching with maps and text

Advance search using maps is used by seraching for a specific site(city), species and trait. The results of the search are then shown in Google Maps. Sites, species and traits can be searched further by clicking on the geographical location on the map. Additionally, there is a legand that shows selected sites that  match serach, don't match search, and sites that fall outside search area. All of these results can be downloaded by clicking the "download results" button on the upper right hand corner.
